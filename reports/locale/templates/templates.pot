#: popup.php:67
msgid ""
"Q. Why isn't the HTML number double the PDF number for interfaces that "
"automatically download HTML?"
msgstr ""

#: popup.php:69
msgid ""
"A. Frequently these sites do NOT automatically download HTML from the Table "
"of Contents browse interface, so even platforms such as ScienceDirect "
"occasionally have higher PDF than HTML counts."
msgstr ""

#: popup.php:71
msgid ""
"Q. I thought COUNTER standards prevented double-counting of article "
"downloads."
msgstr ""

#: popup.php:73
msgid ""
"A. COUNTER does require that duplicate clicks on HTML or PDF within a short "
"period of time be counted once. But COUNTER specifically does not deny "
"double count of different formats--HTML and PDF. Because some publishers "
"automatically choose HTML for users, and because many users prefer to save "
"and/or print the PDF version, this interface significantly inflates total "
"article usage."
msgstr ""

#: popup.php:75
msgid ""
"Q. Why do some Highwire Press publishers have high HTML ratios to PDFs, but "
"some appear to have a very low ratio?"
msgstr ""

#: popup.php:77
msgid ""
"A. Some publishers have automatic HTML display on Highwire, and some do not. "
"This is because the publisher is able to indicate a preferred linking page "
"through the DOI registry. Because this platform includes multiple "
"publishers, the interface impact is not consistent."
